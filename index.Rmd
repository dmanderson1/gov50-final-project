## Abstract

Do joint military exercises between the United States and Japan have a negative impact on either countriesâ€™ trade with China? In this study, I plan to examine the extent to which trade with China fluctuates when the U.S. and Japan conduct joint military exercises. I hypothesize that imports and exports to and from China will decrease for either the U.S. or Japan in response to a more muscular posture as indicated by the joint military exercises. I expect that the decline in trade will be short term and rebound within 6 months. My unit of analysis are months. The explanatory variable of interest is whether there is a net increase or decrease in trade flows. The datasets I am using are the Joint-Military Exercise dataset (Bernhart, 2021) and trade flow data from the Census Bureau.

## Conclusion

1 paragraph (i) summarizing results and assessing the extent to which you find 
support for your hypothesis; (ii) describing limitations of the analysis and 
threats to inference (missing data, confounding, etc), and stating how you 
could improve your analysis if you had more time/money.
