## Introduction


Alliances play a pivotal role in shaping geo-political and geo-economic realities. Defensive alliances, for instance, are forged with the primary objective of collective defense, uniting nations against common threats. Non-aggressive alliances, on the other hand, prioritize cooperation without an explicit military commitment, fostering diplomatic ties and shared interests. Entente, a lesser-known and more flexible arrangement, is meant to facilitate strategic collaboration.

While the security-related implications of alliances are clear, how ought we characterize the relationship between alliance type and trade? Are certain alliances more adept at facilitating trade than others? How do variations in alliance types relate to patterns in trade? Drawing on dyadic datasets compiled by the Correlates of War project, this article examines the interplay between alliance types and trade value. This article expects that defensive alliances are associated with the greatest level of trade value, and the data provides partial support for its hypothesis, albeit with a caveat. The emperical evidence shows that both "defense" and "entente" type alliances are associated with higher levels of trade value relative to "neutrality" and "non-aggression" pacts. This has implications for diplomacy, international trade policy, norms, standards, and security policy. More generally, it prompts questions about the nature of associations and the benefits that can be accrued through said associations. 

The explanatory variable of interest is alliance type.

## Data
2-3 paragraphs + plot visualizing main outcome of interest. (3pts)

The first step is to load the .csv files into R. 


The next step involves merging the Alliance Dataset with the Trade Dataset.

## Conclusion

1 paragraph (i) summarizing results and assessing the extent to which you find 
support for your hypothesis; (ii) describing limitations of the analysis and 
threats to inference (missing data, confounding, etc), and stating how you 
could improve your analysis if you had more time/money. 

The limitations of this analysis are manifold.

The datasets include information about alliance types and trade values for almost every country conceivable, and it spans more than a century. If I had more resources (e.g. time, money, etc.), I might analyze how the alliance type of certain countries are correlated with its trade volume. For instance, I would be interested to know how the U.S.-Japan trade relationship has been impacted by the Security Treaty. I know that there were periods of trade friction, which are coded as spikes and dips in the COW dataset. It would be even more intriguing to think about broader impacts of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. For instance, how did Japan's trade relationship change with China as signing the Security Treaty? Is America's alliance with Japan associated with an increase in trade with other nations? Perhaps countries can use alliances to align on security, but then extend that alignment by linking their cooperation to a host of other issues, as well (i.e. climate change, commerce, global health, human rights, international criminal justice, etc.)
