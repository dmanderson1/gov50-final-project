How do you apply a custom theme to a Distill site or blog? You have two options:

1.  Apply it site-wide by adding a `theme` key to the top-level of your `_site.yml` configuration file:

    ``` {.yaml}
    name: "distill"
    title: "Distill for R Markdown"
    theme: theme.css
    navbar:
      # (navbar definition here)
    ```

2.  Apply to an individual article by adding a `theme` key to your article's YAML front-matter:

    ``` {.yaml}
    ---
    title: "The Sharpe Ratio"
    output:
      distill::distill_article:
        toc: true
        theme: theme.css
    ---
    ```

The second option allows for you to apply your theme to individual articles, while using a different theme for the rest of your site. Note that this is only possible for stand-alone articles within a website --- you cannot apply a theme to individual blog posts *only*.
